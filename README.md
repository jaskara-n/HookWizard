# HookWizard

HookWizard is a Uniswap v4 hook builder and deployment cockpit for HackMoney 2026. It generates audited hooks, deploys pools, and connects off-chain agents to enforce policy and orchestrate liquidity across chains.

## What it does

- Build and deploy Uniswap v4 hooks with toggles:
  - Fee threshold hook
  - On-chain limit order hook
  - Arc USDC-only settlement hook (policy + events)
- Deploy ERC-20 tokens for quick test pools.
- Initialize pools and add liquidity on Sepolia.
- Cross-chain USDC refill using LI.FI API (off-chain).
- Agent-ready: hook events can be consumed by any off-chain agent (Eliza, custom bots, workflows).
- Non-technical friendly: describe a hook in plain English, generate the code, and deploy from the UI.

## Architecture overview

1. Hook Wizard UI
   - Generates hook code based on toggles
   - Deploys hook + initializes pool
   - Shows metrics from the pool and hook contracts
2. Arc USDC-only hook (policy)
   - Enforces USDC-only pools
   - Emits Arc settlement requests
3. Off-chain agent (example script)
   - Listens to Arc settlement events
   - Fetches LI.FI quote for cross-chain USDC refill
   - Can trigger bridge + swap flows

## For non‑developers

HookWizard is designed so non‑technical teams can still ship a working pool:

- Select features from simple toggles.
- Let the app generate the hook contract.
- Deploy, initialize, and add liquidity with guided steps.
- Copy a transaction link for verification.

You can also ask an agent (like Eliza) to generate a custom hook spec and deploy it for you.

## Why Arc + LI.FI

- Arc provides a USDC‑first settlement policy and a canonical balance layer.
  - The hook enforces “USDC only” pools and emits settlement events.
  - Off‑chain systems can reconcile and track USDC balances against Arc.
- LI.FI provides the cross‑chain execution layer.
  - When liquidity is needed, LI.FI routes USDC from any chain into the target pool treasury.

This satisfies the Arc and LI.FI hackathon tracks without putting cross-chain complexity on-chain.

## Sponsors & stack

- Uniswap v4 hooks + PoolManager
- Arc testnet (USDC settlement policy)
- LI.FI API (cross-chain USDC refill)
- Wagmi + RainbowKit + Viem
- Foundry (contracts)

## Setup

Install:

```
npm install
```

Contracts:

```
cd contracts
forge build
```

Run UI:

```
npm run dev
```

## Token deploy (optional)

The Pool Config step includes a simple ERC-20 deployer. The contract mints the full supply to the deployer wallet. This is intended for testing only; use your own production token contracts for real deployments.

## Off-chain agent demo (Arc + LI.FI)

This repo includes a small agent script that listens for Arc settlement events and requests a LI.FI quote.

Run:

```
ARC_RPC_URL=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network \
ARC_HOOK_ADDRESS=0xYourArcHook \
TO_ADDRESS=0xYourTreasury \
FROM_CHAIN_ID=8453 \
FROM_TOKEN=0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913 \
TO_CHAIN_ID=11155111 \
TO_TOKEN=0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238 \
AMOUNT=1000000 \
node scripts/arc-lifi-agent.mjs
```

Notes:

- LI.FI does not support testnets, so the script is used to demonstrate the cross-chain intent and payload.
- Plug the same payload into LI.FI on mainnet for real bridging.

## Hooks

- Fee Threshold Hook: accumulates fees and only transfers above a threshold.
- Limit Order Hook: on-chain limit order execution with price step traversal.
- Arc USDC-only Hook: enforces USDC-only pools and emits settlement requests.

## Agent integrations

Any external agent can subscribe to hook events and respond:

- Eliza agent: monitor ArcSettlementRequested and trigger LI.FI or internal treasury moves.
- Custom automation: rebalancing, alerting, cross-chain funding.

## Prize track alignment

- Uniswap Foundation: v4 hooks + pool deployments with on-chain policy enforcement.
- Arc: USDC-only liquidity policy + Arc settlement events + documented Arc registry usage.
- LI.FI: cross-chain USDC refill flow (quote + execution payload).
